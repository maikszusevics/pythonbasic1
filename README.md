# Data types and Operators
## Two types of operators
### Arithmetic
- ` + - * / `
- `+` adds two operands (var) together
- `-` subtracts two operands (var) 
- `*` multiplies two operands together
- `/` divides two operands



### Comparison Operators
- `>` greater than `a > b`
- `<` less than 
- `==` equals
- `!=` 
- `>=` 
- `<=`

```
a = 4
b = 2
print(a>b)# true
print(a<b)# false
print(a==b)# false
print(a!=b)# true

print(a * b) # 8
```
